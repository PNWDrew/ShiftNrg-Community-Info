ShiftNrg is developing a custom IPFS cluster to provide storage and hosting with user-determined replication and censorship resistance.

## Main repo
https://github.com/ShiftNrg
  This is the source for ShiftNrg official code, including current Lisk based node script and future Substrate node script.

## Tools for node operators on the shift-lisk chain.

### Monitoring, managing, and recovering tools.

https://github.com/MxShift
  MX has multiple tools available to help node operators manage their nodes. This collection is very useful in the event of a chain or node issue.

### Pool scripts to share forged Shift with voters
  Many delegates share a portion of their forgings with the voters who have delegated their votes to run nodes that secure and validate blocks on the chain.

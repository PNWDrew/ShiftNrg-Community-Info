## Tools for node operators on the shift-lisk chain. Most are maintained by delegates. 

    For help using management tools please join Discord

### Monitoring, managing, and recovery tools by community members. If you run a node, you'll want some of these tools.

Delegate mx has [multiple tools](https://github.com/MxShift) available to help node operators manage their nodes. This collection is very useful for delegates in the event of a chain or node issue.

Delegate mrgr also has [tools](https://github.com/mrgrshift) for node management. Some are updated/forked in Mxshift's repo above.

Delegate samuel_paulsun has a few interesting [utilities](https://github.com/samuelpaulsun?tab=repositories)

### Pool scripts to distribute forged Shift with voters for delegates on Lisk chain

Many delegates share a portion of their forgings with their voters.

[Delegate BFX's script](https://github.com/Bx64/shift-pool)

[Delegate PNWDrew's script](https://github.com/PNWDrew/dpos-pool)

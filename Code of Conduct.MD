# Code of Conduct

## The Shift Community Project (ShiftNrg) expects members of this server to BE NICE. 
ShiftNrg maintains this server as a resource for community members. Members will be blocked or banned at our discretion. Actions by admin, team and moderators are not up for debate. Rejoining or having multiple accounts to evade a ban and continue inappropriate behavior is not tolerated. We do not want to ban anyone; please behave in an appropriate manner. 


## Reasons for administrative action include, but are not limited to:

1) Harassment, whether public or private, is not acceptable. We may publicly ask violators to refrain. Severe violations may result in immediate ban.

2) Initiating and/or continuing personal attacks will not be tolerated. Members are advised to not respond to personal attacks. Defending oneself from perceived insults with rebuttals deemed as insulting or offensive is not acceptable and may also result in a ban.

3) Sustained disruption of on-topic discussion in any channel.

4) Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, intelligence, body size, race, or religion.

5) Posts containing images, GIFs and memes are expected to conform to community standards, regardless of intent of post.

6) Continued one-on-one communications after requests to cease.

7) Publication of sensitive, privileged or  private communication in public without consent of all parties.

8) Consistent patterns of poor behavior or behavior inappropriate for this server.
9) Deleting a post to avoid a ban will be treated as if the post remained. A true error is ok, delete and apologize is ok, posting and quickly deleting is not.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any offending behavior are expected to comply immediately.


If a participant engages in harassing, offensive, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this group and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.


We will respect confidentiality requests by members reporting violations of this policy. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name complainants without their affirmative consent.


This code of conduct may be modified as needed to reflect the needs of the community and team.

This code of conduct is based on Annalee Flower Horne's Sample Slack Code of Conduct, which is in turn based on Geek Feminism's Community Anti-Harassment Policy. We have adapted the Sample Slack Code of Conduct for our own use under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License.
